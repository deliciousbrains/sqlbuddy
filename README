INTRODUCTION

SQL Buddy is open source! Use of the application is governed by
a MIT license - see LICENSE file for details.

CHANGELOG

A list of changes made in this version is available online 
at http://www.sqlbuddy.com/releasenotes/

INSTALLATION

To start using SQL Buddy take the folder of unzipped files and 
ftp them to your server. I would recommend placing them in a 
folder such as http://www.yourserver.com/sqlbuddy/. But in
reality, it shouldn't matter where you put them or what you call
the folder.

If you are interested, there is a few variables in config.php that you
can change if you want to customize your installation. It is totally 
optional, and your setup will work just fine if you leave the values at
their defaults.

UPGRADING

To upgrade SQL Buddy, its probably best to delete the old version then
unzip the new version in its place.

TRANSLATIONS

SQL Buddy now has an online hub for translations. It allows a group 
of people to collaborate together on a translation. The address is 
http://www.sqlbuddy.com/translations/. If you have any questions about working
on a translation, feel free to contact me using the form on the website.

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

There is a bunch of keyboard shortcuts available to speed up things like
navigating through results, editing rows, etc. A list of shortcuts is
available on the home tab after you login. If you find the shortcuts 
annoying and would like to disable them, there is a line in main.js that you 
can disable. Its about 50 lines down, and I have left a comment indicating 
which line you need to comment out.
